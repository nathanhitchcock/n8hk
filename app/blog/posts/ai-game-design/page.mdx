## Why AI for Game Design?

AI is great at generating breadth and surfacing surprising possibilities. The craft is in constraining, curating, and systematizing that breadth into playable loops, tuned progression, and evocative fiction.

Seed ideas are cheap; shippable loops are hard. Use AI to explore possibility space, then design systems to make those possibilities legible and fun.

## Systems First, Content Second

Content scales when systems are coherent. Start with verbs, resources, and constraints; layer on narrative and art direction after the loops feel good.

## Tooling and Workflow

- Prompt libraries and model selection
- Data pipes for generating, validating, and playtesting content
- Editor integrations and guardrails

## Risks and Ethics

Operational risks (quality, latency, costs) and design risks (exploit loops, agency, fairness) both matter. Design your game—and your tooling—with those risks in mind.
